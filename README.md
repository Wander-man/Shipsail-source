# Shipsail-source
This is source code and recource files for a small tower-defence game written in C++ using SFML.

You can find an installation file to run this project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S3FJFXxpBpmbzXF0rhkWA9Q2Q_v_MIjb/view?usp=share_link)

A video demonstration of the game will in some time be available here
